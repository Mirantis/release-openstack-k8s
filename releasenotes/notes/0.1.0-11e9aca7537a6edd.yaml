prelude: |
    This is the first release of the OpenStack on Kubernetes
    product. The product includes the following major components:

    * Ceph (TODO add description)
    * The OpenStack controller - implements the Kubernetes Operator
      model by providing the Custom Resource Definiton for
      ``openstackdeployments.lcm.mirantis.com`` and code that handles
      objects defined by this custom resource definition.

      The OpenStack controller is written in Python and is based on
      the Kopf <https://kopf.readthedocs.io/>`_ framework.
      Under the hood, it transforms the specification of the custom resource
      to multiple custom resources, aka HelmBundles. These HelmBundles are
      handled by the Mirantis HelmBundle controller
      and manages deployment of OpenStack and its auxiliary services
      through the ``openstack-helm`` and ``openstack-helm-infra`` Helm charts.

    * Stacklight (TODO add description)

            server to use for the OpenStack notifications
          - Using Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) as a base image for containers
